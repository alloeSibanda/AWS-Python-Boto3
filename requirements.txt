import json
import boto3

# Lambda function code goes here
# The boto3 library is required for interacting with AWS services, and the json5 library is included as an example for handling JSON data. You can adjust the specific 
  versions or include additional dependencies as needed.
# Using this approach, you don't need to specify boto3 & json in the requirements.txt file, and the import statement will directly import the libraries from the Lambda execution environment.
